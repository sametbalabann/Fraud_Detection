  Anomalik - AI-based Credit Card Fraud Detection

Anomalik is a professional anomaly detection project that leverages machine learning and deep learning to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

 Project Overview

This project addresses the critical problem of **credit card fraud detection** using the [Kaggle Credit Card Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It includes three different models:

 **Isolation Forest** – unsupervised anomaly detection  
 **Autoencoder (Neural Network)** – deep learning-based anomaly detection  
 **XGBoost Classifier** – supervised learning with high precision

Each model is trained, evaluated, and logged using ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
